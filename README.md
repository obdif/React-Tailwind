# React and Tailwind CSS Practice

## Overview

This project is a fully responsive website built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS. It showcases a modern and clean design, with an emphasis on simplicity and user experience. The website includes several components that demonstrate my proficiency in both React and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling:** Tailwind CSS is used for all the styling, providing a consistent and streamlined look across the entire site.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** The project follows React's component-based architecture, making the code modular and reusable.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Focus on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Used for adding interactivity and logic.
- **HTML5:** Markup language used to structure the content.
- **CSS3:** Cascading Style Sheets used for styling (via Tailwind CSS).

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
